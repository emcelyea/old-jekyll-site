// first sentence establish the biological truth of this and how it still proves out today
I am this body, I am this mind, I am important, I am special, my needs outweigh others. Biology has written this into each of us. It is the cornerstone of natural-selection. Survive and pass on my genetic material. The humans that walk the earth today are the ones who did just that, and there is no reality where selfless beings outcompete selfish ones. I am important, my needs outweigh others. People consciously admit they are not special, and that their actions are not important, but it takes effort. We don't feel at peace when stuck in traffic. A long line at the grocery store triggers anxiety. We feel as though we are being held back from something, but most likely what we are doing is meaningless. It takes a conscious effort to subdue our default responses to situations like these. It takes conscious effort to admit to ourselves that our needs are no more important than anyone elses. This is not an indictment of self-important behavior, in Darwinian evolution, it is the basis that life is created on.

Societies do not mesh well with self-importance. It is a complex relationship, as our baser instincts needed to be hidden. Suddenly social standing was very important, the way you were perceived by the tribe was crucial. A greedy, violent monkey would be removed from the tribe and the genetic pool.  It makes sense that we evolved with these paradoxical brains. Self-interested, but with the need to simultaneously mask our self-interest so as to maintain or elevate social position. Listen to your stream of consciousness, you can hear it doing this. Rewriting events in the best possible light, taking selfish behavior and creating a narrative that will make it appear palatable. Trying to explain why you do the things you do to an audience that does not exist.
