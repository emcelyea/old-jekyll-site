_Person 1: "Hey have you tried yoga?"_

_Person 2: "Yeah here are my thoughts on it."_

This is a pretty standard conversation. Can you spot what's wrong here?

Did person 1 want a history of person 2's experiences in yoga? Probably not, they probably had some more specific reason they were inquiring about it. Maybe they don't even fully understand the reason. That is what they are going to get though.

Person 2 could have responded with a question. If their focus in the conversation was the other person, the only sensible thing to do would be to ask questions. If their focus in the conversation was yoga, then the sensible thing to do was talk about yoga. What will be borne from that though is two people talking about yoga near one another.
