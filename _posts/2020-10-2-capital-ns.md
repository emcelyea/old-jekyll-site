Politics, a great place for objectivity, blah blah, divisiveness, blahty blah. Should we look at modern psychology and evolutionary psychology when evaluating and designing these systems? Consider these rules, the foundation of natural selection.

1. I am important
2. I am special
3. My needs outweigh others.

Biology has written this into each of us. Survive and pass on genetic material. The humans that walk the earth today are the ones who did just that, and there is no reality where selfless beings outcompete selfish ones. I am important, my needs outweigh others. People consciously admit they are not special, and that their actions are not important, but it takes effort. We don't feel at peace when stuck in traffic. A long line at the grocery store triggers anxiety. We feel as though we are being held back from something, but most likely what we are doing is meaningless. It takes a conscious effort to subdue our default responses to situations like these. It takes conscious effort to admit to ourselves that our needs are no more important than anyone elses. This is not an indictment of self-important behavior, in Darwinian evolution, it is the basis that life is created on.

Societies do not mesh well with self-importance. It is a complex relationship, as our baser instincts need to be hidden. Social standing is very important, the way we are perceived by the tribe is crucial. Historically, a greedy, violent monkey would be removed from the tribe and the genetic pool. It makes sense that we evolved with paradoxical brains. Self-interested, but with the need to simultaneously mask self-interest so as to maintain or elevate social positions. Listen to your stream of consciousness, you can hear it doing this. Rewriting events in the best possible light, taking selfish behavior and creating a narrative that will make it appear palatable. Trying to explain why you do the things you do to an audience that does not exist. Societies have grappled with this self/group conflict throughout history using various ideologies but it remains as the underlying issue to every other issue to this day.


### drafty mode
Now enter Capitalism. It does not ask the individual to behave against their self-interest. Rather it implies that everyone doing the best for themselves is what is best for the group. It has managed to outlast and outperform more idealistic systems, but it is ugly in many ways. We are hardcoded to view our friends in a more benevolent light. We are hardcoded to push our children as far ahead as we can. The definition of what the 'group' is also gets hazy. Is the group a capitalist system serves the country, the world? How do immigrants fit into the group. Racism, sexism, and religious beliefs also lead to seperate in-groups, and people undermining groups they dont associate with. All this behavior is hard-coded, we can trace these behaviors back to that basic primal drive to serve ones own needs and pass on your genetic material. Which is the ridiculous part, almost no one wants to have 40 kids, some of us don't want any. These are residual instincts that no longer serve us.

### full on random idea mode
Capitalism is an appeal to the basic instincts, you can prove you are special, you can feel important, and you can force people to serve your needs. This actually comes to fruition for very few people, but the tangibility of that goal is what keeps us all in the yoke. 

What is the fix for this from an evolutionary perspective
1. appealing to peoples base instincts more strategically, understanding how to cultivate the view that the entire world is your group, and the entire worlds benefit is your benefit. Rather than appealing to empathy directly, or doing something because it is "right", or in the case of white people currently gaining the approval of other white people by showing empathy towards "vulnerable" people (need a more universal context of this), tricking empathy out of people by changing their view of who their "tribe" is.

2. out-educate base instincts, expect more of humanity, evolution of consciousness. We need to embrace the idea that we don't matter, we aren't important, our needs don't outweigh others. Not in the conscious sense but as the future of evolution of the species. Just as society gave rise to the conscious mind so that it could grapple with how to present the self to others, now we need to quiet it. Many people do not want children, no one wants as many children as they can possibly have, so why do let these residual drives dictate our behavior, political beliefs, and view of our fellow human. Eroding the self is as simple as sitting quietly and perceiving problems from other angles. This is hyper-idealism, the very first step is eroding self-importance, once the self is no longer viewed as more important than others empathy becomes way easier.
If we look at modern selfless or philanthropic acts they are actually negative towards this goal. If the end goal is to demonstrate how unimportant the individual is, philanthropy is a demonstration of how important a person can be! Even done anonymously.
